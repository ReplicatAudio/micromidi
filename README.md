## What is "microtonal" music?
Modern western music divides an octave into 12 equally spaced tones. This tuning is known as 12tet or 12 tone equal temperament. In this system each tone in the octave can be considered to be separated by intervals called a semitone. 

The idea behind microtonal music is to explore the tones that we can get by using smaller intervals that a semitone. So for instance a popular microtuning is 24tet which involves splitting the octave into 24 equal tones instead of 12.

You can also use Micromidi divide an octave by unequally. For example, you could use something like [just intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation) which attempts to to assign all notes to frequencies that can be represented as whole number ratios. 

## What is a VST?
A VST ([Virtual Studio Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology)) is a plugin for DAWs ([Digital Audio Workstations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation)). Examples of popular DAWs that this should work with are [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/)(tested) and [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/). However this should work with just about any popular DAW.
